  > ⚠️ **Note:**
  > Some dependencies can be automatically installed with PSD. These are marked in the “Install Assist” column above. Others must be installed manually before proceeding.

  > ⚙️ **Important:**
  > `FreeFEM` and `PETSc` must be compiled with support for **METIS**, **ParMETIS**, and **HPDDM**. These are considered additional critical dependencies when compiling from source.

  On Linux, when `--with-dependencies=yes` is used, PSD builds PETSc with the following package versions and source revisions. The macOS build uses the applicable packages from this list and system-provided numerical libraries:

  | Package | Bundled version or revision |
  | ------- | --------------------------- |
  | HYPRE | 3.1.0 with PETSc fixes (`85b779557005b2eb94c231c1b516e988b87f4e53`) |
  | MUMPS | 5.8.2 |
  | METIS | 5.1.0-p12 |
  | ParMETIS | 4.0.3-p9 |
  | SLEPc | 3.25.1 |
  | HPDDM | 2.4.0 (`b79bf2a23284c4eca63ea04b5c18a325b664db1d`) |
  | ScaLAPACK | 2.2.3 |
  | MMG | 5.8.0 |
  | ParMmg | 1.5.0 |
  | PT-Scotch | 7.0.11 |
  | f2cBLAS/LAPACK | 3.8.0.q2 |

  ## Install from sources

  Here we will provide installation procedure on Ubuntu/MacOS as an example, but PSD can be installed on other OS distributions of choice, by adapting the steps below.
  Before starting ensure you have all the dependencies installed and your system must have an **active Internet access** to fetch and build dependencies.

<!-- tabs:start -->

##### **Ubuntu**

 <pre><code>
 sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev libhdf5-dev \
          liblapack-dev libopenmpi-dev freeglut3-dev \
          cpp g++ gcc gfortran bison flex gdb git \
          m4 make patch pkg-config wget python3 unzip \
          autoconf automake autotools-dev cmake libtirpc-dev libtbb-dev
 </code></pre>


##### **MacOS**

<pre><code>
    brew install m4 git bison hdf5 wget autoconf automake gcc gmsh scotch scalapack openblas
    export HOMEBREW_CC=gcc-15
    export HOMEBREW_CXX=g++-15
    brew install open-mpi  --build-from-source
</code></pre>

<!-- tabs:end -->

  - Obtain the latest version of PSD by cloning the git repository:

  <pre><code>
  git clone https://github.com/psd-projects/psd.git PSD-Sources
  </code></pre>


  - Use automake within the  cloned PSD folder (`PSD-Sources`)

  <pre><code>
  autoreconf -i
  </code></pre>


  - Configure  PSD within the  cloned folder, we will install PSD in `$HOME/PSDinstall`

  <pre><code>
  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/PSDinstall --with-dependencies=yes
  </code></pre>


  > 💡 **Note**: `--with-dependencies=yes` uses `wget` and internet, so make sure you are connected. MEDCoupling is built from its tagged GitHub source together with source builds of HDF5 and MEDFile; PSD no longer downloads the SALOME binary bundle. To bypass the internet limitation, for instance on clusters or supercomputers, users can provide the dependency `*.tar.gz` files within the `/ext` folder and use the flag `--with-zipped_dependencies`.

  > 💡 **Building without MEDCoupling**: MEDCoupling is optional and is only needed for reading and writing SALOME `.med` meshes through the `medio` plugin. To build all other bundled dependencies without downloading or building MEDCoupling, configure with `--with-dependencies=yes --without-medcoupling`. The `medio` plugin and its MED-specific checks will be skipped; `.mesh`, `.msh`, and `.vtk` mesh support remains available.

  > 💡 **Note**: you can decide to not use `--with-dependencies=yes` flag, in this case assure FreeFEM (compiled with PETSc support), MGIS,  MFront, and Gmsh are installed correctly and can be found `PATH` directories.  In case the dependencies are in directories other than the default `PATH`, specify their locations during `./configure` using flags like `--with-FreeFEM=`, `--with-Gmsh=`, etc., use `./configure -h` to know more about these flags or see the [Configuration Flags](#configuration-flags) section.

  - Build PSD directives and install PSD

  <pre><code>
  make
  make install
  </code></pre>


  - Perform a check to see if everything works

  <pre><code>
  make check
  </code></pre>


  - Install PSD tutorials

  <pre><code>
  make tutorials
  </code></pre>


  Now you should have the PSD solver installed on your machine.

  > 💡 **Note**: that, the solver will be installed at `$HOME/PSDinstall`.  The PSD tutorials are installed in `$HOME/PSD-tutorials`.

  ## Docker Image for PSD

  To simplify installation and ensure a consistent runtime environment across platforms, a Docker image for PSD is available. This image can be used on Linux, Windows, and macOS systems with Docker installed hence the image contains a ready‑to‑use installation of PSD.

  **Pulling the Docker Image**

  Download the latest PSD Docker image from Docker Hub:

  <pre><code>
  docker pull mohdafeef/psd:latest
  </code></pre>


  **Running the PSD Docker Container**

  <pre><code>
  docker run -it mohdafeef/psd:latest
  </code></pre>


  PSD is pre-installed and available in `/opt/psd/bin` and is available in `PATH`.

  - PSD tutorials can be generated inside the container by running:

  <pre><code>
  make tutorials
  </code></pre>


  The tutorials will be installed in `/root/PSD-tutorials`

  **PSD installation via spack**

  PSD can be installed using [spack](https://spack.io/), installation process is detailed [here](https://github.com/psd-projects/spack_psd/tree/main#psd-spack-repository).

  #### Configuration flags

  These are a set of commandline flags/options that control your PSD configuration via the automake ligo.

  | **Flag**                     | **Description**                                              | **Examples**                                                 |
  | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | `--prefix`                   | Enter the directory where you wish to install PSD.<br />Note that  you  will  need to  have read and write <br />permission for this directory.<br /><br />*This flag is an optional flag* | `--prefix=/usr` <br /> `--prefix=/usr/local` <br /> `--prefix=/home/install` |
  | `--with-FreeFEM`             | Enter the directory where FreeFem binary has been installed.<br />Tip, in your terminal  `which FreeFem++`  can  help you <br />find this directory.<br /><br />*This flag is an optional flag* | `--with-FreeFEM=/usr/bin` <br />`--with-FreeFEM=/home/install/bin` <br />`--with-FreeFEM=/usr/local/bin` |
  | `--with-Gmsh`                | Enter the directory  where  Gmsh  binary has been installed.<br />Tip, in your terminal `which gmsh`  can help you find this<br />directory.<br /><br />*This flag is an optional flag* | `--with-Gmsh=/usr/bin` <br />`--with-Gmsh=/home/install/bin` <br />`--with-Gmsh=/usr/local/bin` |
